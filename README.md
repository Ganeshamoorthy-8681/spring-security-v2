## Features

- **Authentication**: Support for various authentication mechanisms (form login, OAuth2, JWT, etc.)
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control and method-level security.
- **Custom Security Filters**: Easily extend or customize security filters.
- **Session Management**: Configurable session policies.
- **Password Encoding**: Secure password storage using industry-standard encoders.
- **Integration Examples**: Sample code for integrating Spring Security into existing Spring Boot projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- Spring Boot (recommended)

### Installation
